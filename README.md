# CountryGo

A front end web application for people who want to create a bucket list of countries to travel to.

## Purpose of this Project

I love geography and geopolitics so I decided to use an external API that gives me access to every country in the world. Then I decided to create an app where important information about these countries could be displayed and allow users to bookmark countries that they one day would like to visit. 

### 🔗 Live Deployment
